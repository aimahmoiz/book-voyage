# Book Voyage
 
***Empowering books to travel***

## Ready for a new kind of journey?

Awesome! You made it to our GitHub page :orange_book: :rocket:

We're a tribe of [EDUshifters][EDUshifts] with a mission: giving books movement, and giving movements books.

Book Voyage is a web-based platform to launch and follow travelling books as they move across the globe.
 
This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. Jump straight to one of the sections below, or just scroll down to find out more.

## The first voyage

It all started with a [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.generosity.com/education-fundraising/edushifts-now-collective-book-initiative) with a simple premise: what if we could distribute our book not in any regular fashion, but as part of a collective game? What if all books would be given to participants at a single conference, each with a final destination attached to it? **What if books could travel and connect people?**

This sparked us to test the theory of *six degrees of separation* that would exist between any two people. Instead of simply sharing ideas through a passive book, we wished to create a network of people; a movement united by having shared the ideas in our book.

**This concept is a pilot that we would love to involve you in. If proven succesful, let's make sure many more book voyages will happen across the globe!**
 
## What do we need?
 
**You!** In specific, we are looking for front-end developers who are looking for a Javascript challenge in map APIs, as well as Django/Python developers to contribute to our back-end implementation.

We are very open to suggestions to extend the platform in interesting directions, so please leave a message if you have a great new feature in mind.
